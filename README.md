# flock

Contibutors: Drew Sorrels, Hassan Almas, Andriy Katkov, Dustin Pho, Edward McEnrue

This project is a capstone project for our 2016 Systems and Networking Capstone at Virginia Tech.

To learn more about the project, please see the Flock.pdf file in the repo.

To run our project, you can clone this repo. Then, open it in Intellij IDEA. Try to build the project. If there is an issue with a
missing library for org.json, then you will need to add a library to the module from Maven with the following id: org.json:json:20160212

Once your project is built, you can run it in the IDE and type "start" (no quotes) into the console in order to begin the flock backend.
Once this is running, you can run ./cli/flock.py from your working directory to run the frontend. For more information on what each of
these do, please refer to the Flock.pdf file in the repo.
